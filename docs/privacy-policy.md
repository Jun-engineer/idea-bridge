# IdeaBridge Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 15, 2025_

IdeaBridge ("the App") helps founders and collaborators share startup concepts, collect feedback, and coordinate introductions. This privacy policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, and the options you have. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not access or use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following categories of information to operate the App:

- **Account details:** Name, email address, and optionally phone number when you register or update your profile.
- **Authentication data:** Password hashes, one-time passcodes, and session tokens required to securely sign you in.
- **Profile content:** Bio, skills, interests, and any social or website links you choose to share within your profile.
- **Idea submissions:** Titles, descriptions, attachments, and tags that you publish for other users to review.
- **Feedback and collaboration signals:** Comments, votes, connection requests, and any status you set for an idea (e.g., "open to collaboration").
- **Device and usage data:** IP address, browser or device type, operating system, app version, clickstream, and timestamps recorded automatically when you interact with the App.
- **Support communications:** Questions, feedback, or bug reports you send us via email or in-app forms.

We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive personal information (such as government IDs or payment details) within the App.

## 2. How We Use Information

We process personal information for the following purposes:

- **Provide and improve the App:** Authenticate users, personalize dashboards, and deliver the core matchmaking and idea discovery features.
- **Communication:** Send onboarding tips, respond to support requests, and deliver transactional messages (e.g., verification SMS or email).
- **Security and fraud protection:** Detect suspicious activity, enforce rate limits, and maintain the integrity of user accounts.
- **Analytics:** Understand feature usage patterns, identify bugs, and prioritize roadmap investments. Analytics are aggregated and pseudonymized wherever possible.
- **Legal compliance:** Comply with applicable laws, respond to lawful requests, and enforce our Terms of Service.

## 3. When We Share Information

We share information only when necessary:

- **Service providers:** With cloud hosting, analytics, and notification partners that assist in delivering the App. These providers are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data and only use it on our behalf.
- **Legal obligations:** When required to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other legal process.
- **Business transfers:** In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we may transfer the data we store, provided the receiving party agrees to respect this privacy policy.

We do not sell your personal information.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain personal information for as long as your account remains active and for a reasonable period afterward to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce agreements. You may request deletion of your account and related data at any time (see Section 9).

## 5. International Data Transfers

IdeaBridge is provisioned on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that may process and store data in regions outside your home country. We implement safeguards consistent with industry standards to protect your information during transfer and storage.

## 6. Security

We employ administrative, technical, and physical safeguards such as encryption in transit, access controls, multi-factor authentication for administrators, automated monitoring, and regular security reviews. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

The App is not directed to, nor intentionally used by, children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:

- Access, correct, or delete personal information we hold about you.
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities.
- Withdraw consent where processing relies on consent.
- Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in Section 10. We may ask for additional verification before processing your request.

## 9. Managing Your Account

You can update most profile details directly within the App. To delete your account or request removal of specific content, submit a support ticket or email us at the address below. Account deletion will remove identifying information from our active systems within 30 days, subject to legal retention requirements.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top and, if changes are significant, provide additional notice through the App or by email.

By continuing to use the App after an update takes effect, you accept the revised policy.
